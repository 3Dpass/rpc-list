# RPC API providers list
This repo allows for an easy management of the RPC API providers list.
The endpoints provide public remote access for web3 wallets and dApps to the LoT network and are maintained by the community members. 

Due to the LoT decentralized nature this repo cannot embrace the ultimate list of the endpoints available, 
providing just short number of well tested ones. 

## Adding RPC API provider
For the network maintainers willing to add new RPC API endpoints to the list Pull Request is required.
